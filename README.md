# Hi, I’m Vinayak Jaybhaye

I’m a B.Tech Computer Science student based in Pune.  
I enjoy building software, understanding how systems work, and learning new technologies by actually using them.

I like keeping things simple and practical. Most of my learning comes from building projects, breaking them, and improving them over time.
